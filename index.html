        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="image" alt="Photo of Swayam">
        <p>
            Hi! My name is Swayam, and I’m currently a student exploring the exciting intersection of technology and media. 
            My interest lies in understanding how digital tools shape modern storytelling, creativity, and communication. 
            I enjoy delving into how different types of media influence our society and enable people to connect across boundaries. 
            In this class, I aim to build a foundation for creating meaningful digital experiences that resonate with people.
        </p>

        <h2>Media I Use</h2>
        <h3>Content Consumption</h3>
        <p>
            Media plays a huge role in my daily life. Here’s how I consume content across different platforms:
        </p>
        <p><strong>Music:</strong> My go-to genre is K-pop. I love the vibrant performances and catchy melodies of groups like Twice, Blackpink, and EXO. Whether I’m working or relaxing, music is my constant companion, and I often discover new artists through Spotify and YouTube playlists.</p>
        <p><strong>Games:</strong> I enjoy a mix of games depending on my mood. For open-world exploration, I play <em>Genshin Impact</em>, where the stunning visuals and intricate storylines keep me engaged. When I’m looking for a quick challenge, I turn to puzzle games like <em>Minesweeper</em> that test my logical thinking skills.</p>
        <p><strong>Pictures:</strong> Visual content like digital art, memes, and photography inspire me. I often scroll through Instagram and Pinterest to admire the creativity of artists and photographers, and I save ideas that spark my own creativity.</p>
        <p><strong>Videos:</strong> My video preferences range from entertaining TV shows to educational tutorials. I love binge-watching shows like <em>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</em> for its humor and unique characters. For deeper insights, I explore documentaries like those on Rotten Tomatoes, and for hobbies, I watch painting tutorials to improve my skills.</p>
    
        <h3>Content Generation</h3>
        <p>
            Generating content is just as important to me as consuming it. I engage in creating written, visual, and technical content regularly:
        </p>
        <p><strong>Email and Messaging:</strong> Communication tools are essential in my daily routine.  
            - Gmail is my go-to for formal emails, assignments, and communicating with professors or colleagues.  
            - Slack and Microsoft Teams streamline group project collaboration, making it easy to share files and communicate in real-time.  
            - WhatsApp is where I maintain personal relationships, bridging the gap with friends and family.</p>
        <p><strong>Digital Writing:</strong> Writing helps me organize and share my thoughts:  
            - I use Google Docs for assignments, essays, and collaborative projects.  
            - Medium is where I publish personal blogs, writing about topics like technology trends, personal growth, or storytelling.</p>
        <p><strong>Social Media Content:</strong> Social media is a creative outlet where I balance personal expression with professional growth.  
            - On Instagram, I share photography experiments, personal achievements, and visually appealing stories.  
            - On LinkedIn, I focus on professional development, sharing milestones, engaging with peers, and learning from industry leaders.</p>
        <p><strong>Programming and Technical Content:</strong> Technology is a significant part of my content creation.  
            - I use Python for scripting tasks, data analysis, and projects like autograders or data visualizations.  
            - R is my tool for statistical analysis and creating detailed data visualizations.  
            - GitHub serves as a portfolio for my projects, allowing me to collaborate, showcase work, and ensure version control.</p>
        <p><strong>Creative Content:</strong> Occasionally, I experiment with graphic design and video editing.  
            - Canva is my go-to for creating posters, presentations, and visual content.  
            - For video editing, I use **DaVinci Resolve** to fine-tune and polish content for presentations or social media.</p>

        <h2>Challenges with Media Tools</h2>
        <p>
            While media tools empower creativity and connectivity, they come with their own set of challenges. For instance, mastering software like Photoshop or advanced video editing platforms requires a steep learning curve. I often find myself dedicating significant time to learning the nuances of these tools, but the results are rewarding.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another challenge is managing the overwhelming variety of content available for consumption. Platforms like YouTube and Netflix often lead to unintentional binge-watching, making it difficult to maintain focus and prioritize my time. I’m working on being more intentional with my media choices to ensure they align with my personal and professional goals.
