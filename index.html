        <p>I am taking the "Computers and New Media" class to explore how technology shapes storytelling, creativity, and communication. I find it fascinating how media consumption and creation influence personal and societal connections. Through this class, I aim to enhance my skills in creating meaningful digital content and better understand the broader implications of media in our lives.</p>

        <h2>Challenges with Media Tools</h2>
        <p>One challenge I face with media tools is managing the learning curve for sophisticated platforms like Photoshop or advanced video editing software. These tools are powerful but often require significant time and effort to use effectively.</p>
        <p>For content consumption, I struggle with staying focused due to the vast amount of content available. On platforms like YouTube or Netflix, itâ€™s easy to spend hours exploring recommendations, which can make consuming media feel less intentional.</p>
