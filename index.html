        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="image" alt="Photo of Swayam">
        <p>
            Hi! My name is Swayam, and I’m currently a student exploring the exciting intersection of technology and media. 
            My interest lies in understanding how digital tools shape modern storytelling, creativity, and communication. 
            I enjoy delving into how different types of media influence our society and enable people to connect across boundaries. 
            In this class, I aim to build a foundation for creating meaningful digital experiences that resonate with people.

        <h2>Media I Use</h2>
        <h3>Content Consumption</h3>
        <p>
            Media plays a huge role in my daily life. Here’s how I consume content across different platforms:
        </p>
        <p><strong>Music:</strong> My go-to genre is K-pop. I love the vibrant performances and catchy melodies of groups like Twice, Blackpink, and EXO. Whether I’m working or relaxing, music is my constant companion, and I often discover new artists through Spotify and YouTube playlists.</p>
        <p><strong>Games:</strong> I enjoy a mix of games depending on my mood. For open-world exploration, I play <em>Genshin Impact</em>, where the stunning visuals and intricate storylines keep me engaged. When I’m looking for a quick challenge, I turn to puzzle games like <em>Minesweeper</em> that test my logical thinking skills.</p>
        <p><strong>Pictures:</strong> Visual content like digital art, memes, and photography inspire me. I often scroll through Instagram and Pinterest to admire the creativity of artists and photographers, and I save ideas that spark my own creativity.</p>
        <p><strong>Videos:</strong> My video preferences range from entertaining TV shows to educational tutorials. I love binge-watching shows like <em>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</em> for its humor and unique characters. For deeper insights, I explore documentaries like those on Rotten Tomatoes, and for hobbies, I watch painting tutorials to improve my skills.</p>

        <h3>Content Generation</h3>
        <p>
            On the creation side, I engage in a variety of activities. Writing and coding are two key areas where I express myself and solve problems.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Email and Messaging:</strong> Tools like Gmail, Slack, WhatsApp, and Microsoft Teams allow me to stay connected with colleagues, classmates, and friends. Whether it’s quick updates or detailed conversations, I use these tools every day.</p>
        <p><strong>Digital Writing:</strong> I use Google Docs and Medium for academic work and personal writing. These platforms help me organize my thoughts and share my ideas with a broader audience.</p>
        <p><strong>Social Media Content:</strong> Platforms like Instagram and LinkedIn are where I share moments from my life and professional achievements. I enjoy crafting posts that highlight my journey and connect me with like-minded people.</p>
        <p><strong>Programming:</strong> I create scripts and work on technical projects using Python, R, and GitHub. These tools help me develop innovative solutions and manage collaborative projects effectively.</p>

        <h2>Challenges with Media Tools</h2>
        <p>
            While media tools empower creativity and connectivity, they come with their own set of challenges. For instance, mastering software like Photoshop or advanced video editing platforms requires a steep learning curve. I often find myself dedicating significant time to learning the nuances of these tools, but the results are rewarding.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another challenge is managing the overwhelming variety of content available for consumption. Platforms like YouTube and Netflix often lead to unintentional binge-watching, making it difficult to maintain focus and prioritize my time. I’m working on being more intentional with my media choices to ensure they align with my personal and professional goals.
